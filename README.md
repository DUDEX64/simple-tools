# Simple Tools
A collection of small useful tools for Windows and GNU/Linux
- - - -

For almost 7 years now, I have made small automation scripts to make
command line tasks quicker. It just seems logical to open these simple
tools to the public. All of these tools are free and open soure, and they
always will be.
